# Introduction

Showcasing the work I did for my bidpro-admin project.

# Getting Started

1. Create a new MongoDB Connection.
2. Replace "MONGO_DB_CONNECTION" in server.js with your own connection.
3. Use the database template located in "bidpro-admin-api\api\bidpro_test\json-setup\bidtypes-setup.json" to mock up your database.
4. Run npm start.

# Testing

Example: `npm run test bidpro/BidPeriodAddPost`
